# Network Security Groups (NSGs)

---

## Key Concepts

### Purpose of NSGs:
- NSGs control inbound and outbound network traffic for virtual networks (VNets) and virtual machines (VMs).
- Act as a networking filter to allow or deny traffic based on rules.

### NSG Rules:
- Each NSG contains **inbound** and **outbound** rules.
- Rules define traffic flow permissions based on:
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
  - Source and destination IP addresses or service tags.
  - Source and destination port ranges.
- Rules are applied based on **priority** (lower numbers are processed first).

### Application of NSGs:
- NSGs can be associated with:
  - A **subnet** (applies to all resources in the subnet).
  - A VM’s **network interface** (applies only to that VM).

## NSG Rule Properties

| Property                  | Description                                                                 | Constraints                          | Considerations                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                  | Unique name for the rule.                                                   | Must be unique within the region.    | Use a naming convention to identify the rule’s purpose.                        |
| **Protocol**              | Network protocol the rule applies to (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or * for all).        | Use * for all protocols (includes ICMP). | Use **Any** in the Azure portal instead of *.                                  |
| **Source Port Range**     | Source port(s) to match for the rule.                                       | Single port, range (e.g., 1-65535), or * for all ports. | Use * for ephemeral ports unless a specific port is required.                  |
| **Destination Port Range**| Destination port(s) to match for the rule.                                  | Single port, range, or * for all ports. | Combine multiple ports/ranges in one rule to reduce the number of rules.       |
| **Source Address Prefix** | Source IP address(es), subnet(s), or service tag(s) to match for the rule.  | Single IP, subnet, service tag, or * for all addresses. | Use ranges, service tags, or application security groups to simplify rules.    |
| **Destination Address Prefix** | Destination IP address(es), subnet(s), or service tag(s) to match for the rule. | Single IP, subnet, service tag, or * for all addresses. | Use ranges, service tags, or application security groups to simplify rules.    |
| **Direction**             | Direction of traffic (inbound or outbound).                                 | Must be either inbound or outbound.  | Inbound and outbound rules are processed separately.                           |
| **Priority**              | Order in which rules are evaluated (lower numbers are processed first).     | Unique number between 100 and 4096.  | Leave gaps (e.g., 100, 200, 300) for future rules.                             |
| **Action**                | Action to take if the rule matches (allow or deny).                         | Must be either allow or deny.        | If no rule matches, traffic is denied by default.                              |

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **Rule Priority:**
  - Rules are evaluated in ascending order of priority (e.g., 100, 101, 102).
  - Once a matching rule is found, no further rules are evaluated.
  - Example: A deny rule with priority 125 will override an allow rule with priority 250.
- **Default Rules:**
  - NSGs include default rules with priorities 65001 to 65003:
    - Allow inbound traffic from the virtual network.
    - Allow outbound traffic to the internet.
    - Deny all other traffic.
- **Traffic Flow:**
  - Inbound and outbound rules are processed separately.
  - If no rule matches, traffic is denied by default.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use service tags (e.g., `VirtualNetwork`, `Internet`) to simplify rules.
  - Use application security groups to group VMs and apply rules collectively.
  - Avoid overlapping rules by leaving gaps in priority values.

# Service Tags and Default NSG Rules

---

## Key Concepts

### Service Tags:
- **Purpose:** Simplify NSG rules by providing platform-defined shortcuts for Azure service IP ranges.
- **Benefits:**
  - Automatically updated as Azure service IP ranges change.
  - Eliminate the need to manually track and update IP ranges.
- **Usage:** Typically used in outbound rules to control access to Azure services.

### Common Service Tags:
| Service Tag              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VirtualNetwork**        | Includes the entire VNet address space, connected VNets, and on-premises networks (via VPN/ExpressRoute). |
| **Internet**              | Represents public Internet address space, including Azure public IPs.      |
| **AzureCloud**            | Represents Azure data center public IPs (can be region-scoped, e.g., `AzureCloud.EastUS`). |
| **AzureLoadBalancer**     | Represents IPs for Azure Load Balancer health probes.                       |
| **AzureTrafficManager**   | Represents IPs for Azure Traffic Manager health probes.                     |
| **Storage**               | Represents IPs for Azure Storage (can be region-scoped, e.g., `Storage.WestUS`). |
| **Sql**                   | Represents IPs for Azure SQL Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Synapse Analytics (can be region-scoped). |

### Limitations:
- Service tags control access to the service, not specific resources within the service.
- Example: A rule allowing `Storage` access cannot restrict access to a specific storage account.

---

## Default NSG Rules

### Purpose:
- Provide baseline traffic control for all NSGs.

### Characteristics:
- Cannot be added, edited, or deleted.
- Have the lowest priority (can be overridden by custom rules).
- Processed after custom rules.

---

### Default Inbound Rules

| Name                          | Priority | Source            | Source Port | Destination       | Destination Port | Protocol | Access |
|-------------------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| **AllowVNetInBound**           | 65000    | VirtualNetwork    | Any         | VirtualNetwork    | Any              | Any      | Allow  |
| **AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound** | 65001 | AzureLoadBalancer | Any         | Any               | Any              | Any      | Allow  |
| **DenyAllInBound**             | 65500    | Any               | Any         | Any               | Any              | Any      | Deny   |

---

### Default Outbound Rules

| Name                          | Priority | Source            | Source Port | Destination       | Destination Port | Protocol | Access |
|-------------------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| **AllowVNetOutBound**          | 65000    | VirtualNetwork    | Any         | VirtualNetwork    | Any              | Any      | Allow  |
| **AllowInternetOutBound**      | 65001    | Any               | Any         | Internet          | Any              | Any      | Allow  |
| **DenyAllOutBound**            | 65500    | Any               | Any         | Any               | Any              | Any      | Deny   |

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **Service Tags:**
  - Simplify NSG rules by automatically updating IP ranges.
  - Use region-scoped tags (e.g., `Storage.WestUS`) for granular control.
- **Default Rules:**
  - Allow intra-VNet and outbound internet traffic by default.
  - Deny all other traffic unless explicitly allowed by custom rules.
- **Load Balancer Traffic:**
  - The `AzureLoadBalancer` tag only applies to health probes, not traffic passing through the load balancer.
- **Rule Priority:**
  - Custom rules override default rules due to higher priority (lower numbers).

# Application Security Groups (ASGs)

---

## Key Concepts

### Purpose of ASGs:
- Simplify network segmentation and security management by grouping VMs based on application tiers (e.g., web, app, database).
- Eliminate the need for complex subnet planning and multiple NSGs.

### Benefits of ASGs:
- **Flexible IP Management:** All VMs can reside in a single subnet, reducing IP space wastage.
- **Centralized NSG Rules:** A single NSG can define traffic flows between application tiers.
- **Scalability:** Reuse security policies without manually updating IP addresses.

### How ASGs Work:
- VMs are associated with ASGs based on their role (e.g., web server, app server).
- NSG rules reference ASGs instead of IP addresses, making rules easier to manage and understand.

---

## Steps to Configure ASGs

1. **Create ASGs:**
   - Create an ASG resource for each application tier (e.g., `WebServers`, `AppServers`, `DatabaseServers`).
   - No properties are required other than name, resource group, and location.
2. **Associate VMs with ASGs:**
   - Assign the network interface of each VM to the appropriate ASG.
   - A VM can belong to multiple ASGs.
3. **Define NSG Rules Using ASGs:**
   - Create NSG rules using ASG names as source or destination instead of IP ranges.
   - Example: Allow traffic from `WebServers` ASG to `AppServers` ASG on port 80.

---

## Example: Three-Tier Application Architecture

| Application Tier | ASG Name        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Web Tier**     | `WebServers`    | Handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet.                               |
| **App Tier**     | `AppServers`    | Processes requests from the web tier and interacts with the database tier.  |
| **Database Tier**| `DatabaseServers` | Stores application data and responds to queries from the app tier.        |

---

## Steps to Create an NSG with ASGs (Azure Portal)

1. **Create NSG:**
   - Go to **Create a Resource > Networking > Network Security Group**.
   - Provide a name, subscription, resource group, and location.
2. **Add Inbound Rules:**
   - Example: Allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic (ports 80 and 443) from any source to the `WebServers` ASG.
     - **Source:** Any
     - **Source Port Ranges:** *
     - **Destination:** `WebServers` ASG
     - **Destination Port Ranges:** 80,443
     - **Protocol:** TCP
     - **Action:** Allow
     - **Priority:** 100
     - **Name:** `Allow_HTTP_HTTPS`
     - **Description:** Allow HTTP and HTTPS inbound traffic on ports 80 and 443.
3. **Review and Apply:**
   - Verify the rule in the NSG overview blade.
   - Apply the NSG to the subnet or VM network interfaces.

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **ASGs vs. Subnets:**
  - ASGs eliminate the need for subnet-based segmentation.
  - All VMs can reside in a single subnet, simplifying IP management.
- **NSG Rules with ASGs:**
  - Rules reference ASG names instead of IP ranges.
  - Example: Allow traffic from `WebServers` to `AppServers`.
- **Scalability:**
  - ASGs allow easy scaling of VMs without reconfiguring NSGs or subnets.
- **Centralized Management:**
  - A single NSG can manage traffic flows for all application tiers.

# Associating NSGs and Evaluating Effective Security Rules

---

## Key Concepts

### Associating NSGs:
- NSGs can be associated with:
  - **Network Interfaces (NICs):** Applies to all IP configurations on the NIC.
  - **Subnets:** Applies to all resources within the subnet.
- Each NIC or subnet can only be associated with one NSG, but a single NSG can be associated with multiple NICs or subnets.

### Traffic Flow with NSGs:
- **Inbound Traffic:**
  - Subnet NSG rules are applied first.
  - NIC NSG rules are applied next.
  - Traffic is allowed only if both NSGs permit it.
- **Outbound Traffic:**
  - NIC NSG rules are applied first.
  - Subnet NSG rules are applied next.
  - Traffic is allowed only if both NSGs permit it.

### Best Practices:
- Avoid associating NSGs to both subnets and NICs within the same subnet (though it is supported).
- Use subnet-level NSGs for consistent rules across multiple VMs.
- Use NIC-level NSGs for granular control over individual VMs.

---

## Steps to Associate an NSG with a Subnet (Azure Portal)

1. **Navigate to NSG:**
   - Open the NSG blade in the Azure portal.
2. **Associate with Subnet:**
   - Click **Subnets > +Associate**.
   - Select the **Virtual Network** and **Subnet** (must be in the same region as the NSG).
3. **Save the association.**
4. **Result:**
   - The NSG rules are now enforced for all resources in the subnet.

---

## Effective Security Rules

### Purpose:
- Provides visibility into how NSG rules are applied to a VM.
- Shows the exact source and destination IP prefixes for each rule, even when using service tags or application security groups.

### Accessing Effective Security Rules:
- Open the **Virtual Machine blade > Networking > Effective Security Rules**.
- The VM must be running to view this information.

### Key Features:
- Lists all NSG rules applied to the VM.
- Clicking a rule shows the exact IP prefixes used (e.g., 122 prefixes for outbound internet traffic).

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **NSG Application:**
  - Subnet-level NSGs apply to all resources in the subnet.
  - NIC-level NSGs apply to individual VMs.
  - Traffic must be allowed by both NSGs (if both are applied).
- **Effective Security Rules:**
  - Use this feature to troubleshoot networking issues.
  - Provides clarity on how service tags and ASGs translate to IP prefixes.
- **Example Scenario:**
  - **Subnet NSG:** Allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic (ports 80/443) from any source.
  - **NIC NSG:** Denies traffic from a specific IP range.
  - **Result:** Traffic is denied if it matches the NIC NSG rule, even if allowed by the subnet NSG.

# Implementing Azure Firewall

---

## Key Concepts

### Azure Firewall Overview:
- A managed, cloud-based network security service for Azure resources.
- Provides high availability, scalability, and centralized management.
- **Key features:**
  - Outbound SNAT (Source Network Address Translation).
  - Inbound DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation).
  - Azure Monitor logging for traffic analysis.

### Firewall Rules:
- **Application Rules:**
  - Allow or deny outbound traffic based on fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
  - Example: Allow access to `www.microsoftpressstore.com`.
- **Network Rules:**
  - Allow or deny traffic based on source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols.
  - Example: Allow DNS traffic to OpenDNS servers.

### Deployment Models:
- **Hub-and-Spoke Model:**
  - Azure Firewall is deployed in a central hub VNet.
  - Other resources are placed in spoke VNets peered to the hub.
- **Single VNet Model:**
  - Azure Firewall is deployed in a dedicated subnet within the same VNet as the resources.

### Subnet Requirements:
- Azure Firewall must be deployed in a subnet named **AzureFirewallSubnet**.
- The subnet must have a minimum address space of `/26`.

---

## Steps to Deploy and Configure Azure Firewall

   - Add a route with:
     - **Address Prefix:** `0.0.0.0/0` (default route).
     - **Next Hop Type:** Virtual Appliance.
     - **Next Hop Address:** Private IP of Azure Firewall.

### 5. Add Application Rule Collection
1. Go to **ExamRef-Firewall > Rules > Application Rule Collection > +Add**.
2. **Configure:**
   - Name: `Allow-MicrosoftPressStore`.
   - Priority: `100`.
   - Action: `Allow`.
   - Source IP: `10.1.1.0/24` (WorkloadSubnet).
   - Protocol: `https`.
   - Target FQDN: `www.microsoftpressstore.com`.

### 6. Add Network Rule Collection
1. Go to **ExamRef-Firewall > Rules > Network Rule Collection > +Add**.
2. **Configure:**
   - Name: `Allow-DNS`.
   - Priority: `100`.
   - Action: `Allow`.
   - Source IP: `10.1.1.0/24` (WorkloadSubnet).
   - Protocol: `UDP`.
   - Destination IP: `208.67.222.222`, `208.67.220.220` (OpenDNS servers).
   - Destination Port: `53`.

### 7. Configure Custom DNS on Workload VM
1. Go to the network interface of `ExamRef-Work`.
2. Add custom DNS servers: `208.67.222.222` and `208.67.220.220`.
3. Restart the VM to apply changes.

### 8. Test Azure Firewall
1. **Connect to Jump Host:**
   - Use the public IP of `ExamRef-Jump` to RDP into the VM.
2. **Access Workload VM:**
   - From `ExamRef-Jump`, RDP into `ExamRef-Work` using its private IP.
3. **Test Application Rule:**
   - Open a browser on `ExamRef-Work` and navigate to `https://www.microsoftpressstore.com`.
   - Access should be allowed.
4. **Test Blocked Traffic:**
   - Attempt to access other websites (e.g., `www.microsoft.com`).
   - Access should be blocked unless explicitly allowed by a rule.

---

## Key Points to Remember

- **Azure Firewall Subnet:**
  - Must be named `AzureFirewallSubnet` with a `/26` address space.
- **Rule Types:**
  - **Application Rules:** Control traffic based on FQDNs.
  - **Network Rules:** Control traffic based on IPs, ports, and protocols.
- **Routing:**
  - Use a route table to direct traffic through Azure Firewall.
- **Testing:**
  - Use a jump host to securely test firewall rules.
 
---

## Creating a DNAT Rule in Azure Firewall

### DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation)
- Allows external users to access internal resources via the firewall’s public IP address.
- Translates the firewall’s public IP and port to the private IP and port of the target resource.

### Use Case
- Enables direct RDP access to a VM (e.g., `ExamRef-Work`) through the firewall’s public IP, eliminating the need for a jump host.

---

## Steps to Create a DNAT Rule

### 1. Navigate to Azure Firewall Rules
- Go to `ExamRef-Firewall` > **Rules**.
- Select **NAT Rule Collection** > **+ Add NAT Rule Collection**.

### 2. Configure NAT Rule Collection
- **Name**: Provide a name for the rule collection (e.g., `Allow-RDP`).
- **Priority**: Set a priority value (lower numbers have higher priority).

### 3. Add NAT Rule
Under **Rules**, configure the following:

| Field                  | Value                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Protocol**           | TCP                            |
| **Source**             | `*` (allows traffic from any source IP) |
| **Destination IP**     | Public IP of the firewall (e.g., `20.39.143.187`) |
| **Destination Port**   | `3389` (default RDP port)      |
| **Translated Address** | Private IP of the target VM (e.g., `10.1.1.4` for `ExamRef-Work`) |
| **Translated Port**    | `3389` (default RDP port)      |

### 4. Save and Test
- Save the NAT rule collection.
- Test the rule by connecting to the VM:
  - Use the firewall’s public IP (`20.39.143.187`) and port `3389` to RDP into `ExamRef-Work`.

---

## Key Points to Remember

### DNAT Rule Components
- **Destination IP**: Firewall’s public IP.
- **Translated Address**: Private IP of the target resource.
- **Ports**: Typically `3389` for RDP.

### Use Cases
- Direct access to VMs without a jump host.
- Secure access to internal resources via the firewall.

### Testing
- Use RDP to connect to the firewall’s public IP and verify access to the target VM.

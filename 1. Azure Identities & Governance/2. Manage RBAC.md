# 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Overview

RBAC manages access to Azure resources by assigning roles to **security principals** (users, groups, service principals, or managed identities) at specific **scopes** (subscription, resource group, or resource level).

## Key Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Principals** | Entities like users, groups, service principals, or managed identities.     |
| **Role**            | Defines allowed/denied actions (e.g., read, write, delete).                 |
| **Role Assignment**  | Links a role to a security principal at a specific scope.                   |
| **Scope**           | Defines the boundary for access (e.g., management group, subscription, resource group, or resource). |
| **Role Inheritance** | Child resources inherit role assignments from parent scopes.                |
| **Additive Model**  | Overlapping role assignments result in the most privileged access taking precedence. |

## RBAC Scopes (Hierarchy)

1. **Management Group** (Top-level scope, supports up to 10,000 groups per tenant).
2. **Subscription** (Inherits from management group).
3. **Resource Group** (Inherits from subscription).
4. **Resource** (Inherits from resource group).

## Role Types

| Role Type       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Built-in Roles** | Predefined roles like Owner, Contributor, Reader, Storage Blob Data Reader, etc. |
| **Custom Roles** | User-defined roles with specific permissions.                               |

## Important Notes

- **RBAC vs. Azure AD Roles**: RBAC manages Azure resources, while Azure AD roles manage identity tasks (e.g., creating users, resetting passwords).
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Always grant the minimum required permissions.
- **Role Assignment Limits**:
  - 2,000 role assignments per subscription.
  - 500 role assignments per management group.
- **Deny Assignments**: Used to block access at child scopes (e.g., via Azure Blueprints or resource locks).

## Example Scenario

| Security Group     | Role        | Scope               | Access                                      |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| IT Audit           | Reader      | Subscription        | Read access to all resource groups and resources. |
| Application Admins | Contributor | Selected Resource Group | Manage resources in specific resource groups. |
| Application Owners | Owner       | Selected Resource Group | Full control over specific resource groups. |

# 2. Custom Roles Overview

Custom roles in Azure allow you to define specific permissions that are not available in built-in roles. They can be created using the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API.

## Key Points

| Aspect               | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Provide tailored permissions not available in built-in roles.           |
| **Limits**           | - 5,000 custom roles per directory (Azure Global).                     |
|                      | - 2,000 custom roles for Azure Germany and Azure China 21Vianet.       |
| **Creation Methods** | - Clone an existing built-in role.                                     |
|                      | - Start from scratch.                                                  |
|                      | - Use a JSON file.                                                     |
| **Required Permission** | `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` on all assignable scopes. |

## Steps to Create a Custom Role (Azure Portal)

1. **Access IAM Blade**:
   - Go to **Access Control (IAM)** in a subscription or resource group.
   - Click **+ Add > Add Custom Role**.

2. **Baseline Permissions**:
   - Choose one of the following:
     - **Clone a Role**: Start with a built-in role (e.g., Virtual Machine Contributor).
     - **Start from Scratch**: Define permissions manually.
     - **Start from JSON**: Upload a JSON file with role definitions.

3. **Add/Exclude Permissions**:
   - Use the **Actions** tab to add permissions (e.g., `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action`).
   - Use the **Not Actions** tab to exclude permissions.
   - Explore permissions using the [ARM Resource Provider Operations reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations).

4. **Assignable Scopes**:
   - Define where the role can be assigned (e.g., subscription, resource group, or resource level).

5. **Review + Create**:
   - Review the JSON code generated based on your selections.
   - Download the JSON file or copy it for reuse.
   - Click **Create** to finalize the custom role.

## Custom Role JSON Structure

| Attribute           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**            | Name of the custom role.                                                    |
| **Id**              | Unique identifier for the role.                                             |
| **Description**     | Description of the roleâ€™s purpose.                                          |
| **IsCustom**        | Set to `true` for custom roles.                                             |
| **Actions[]**       | Permissions the role allows.                                                |
| **NotActions[]**    | Permissions the role explicitly denies.                                     |
| **AssignableScopes[]** | Scopes where the role can be assigned (e.g., `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`). |

## Example: Cloning a Built-in Role

1. Go to the **Roles** tab in IAM.
2. Select a built-in role (e.g., Virtual Machine Contributor).
3. Click the ellipsis (`...`) and select **Clone**.
4. Modify permissions and assignable scopes as needed.

# 3. Managing Role Assignments

Role assignments in Azure are used to grant or revoke access to resources. This can be done using:

- **Azure Portal**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure SDKs**
- **Resource Manager REST APIs**

## Access Control (IAM) Blade

The **Access Control (IAM)** blade is the central interface for managing role assignments in the Azure portal. It is available at all scopes:

- **Management Group**
- **Subscription**
- **Resource Group**
- **Resource**

## Key Tabs in IAM Blade

| Tab                  | Functionality                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Check Access**     | View effective access rights for a security principal, including inherited access. |
| **Role Assignments** | Add, edit, or remove role assignments.                                        |
| **Deny Assignments** | View deny assignments (controlled by Microsoft, e.g., via Azure Blueprints).   |
| **Classic Administrators** | Manage permissions for classic resources.                                |
| **Roles**            | View built-in and custom roles.                                               |

## Steps to Assign a Role

1. **Navigate to IAM**:
   - Go to the **Access Control (IAM)** blade for the desired scope (e.g., resource group).

2. **Add Role Assignment**:
   - Click **Add > Add Role Assignment**.
   - Select the **Role** (e.g., Virtual Machine Contributor).
   - Choose the **Security Principal** (user, group, or service principal) from the Azure AD tenant.
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Verify Assignment**:
   - The role assignment will appear in the **Role Assignments** tab.

## Steps to Remove a Role Assignment

1. Navigate to the **Role Assignments** tab.
2. Select the security principal(s) to remove.
3. Click **Remove**.

## Example: Assigning Virtual Machine Contributor Role

1. Go to the **Resource Group > Access Control (IAM)**.
2. Click **Add > Add Role Assignment**.
3. Select **Virtual Machine Contributor** as the role.
4. Choose the user (e.g., `cloudadmin@opsgility.onmicrosoft.com`).
5. Click **Save**.

## Important Notes

- **Deny Assignments**:
  - Cannot be created or modified manually in the IAM blade.
  - Controlled via Azure Blueprints or Resource Locks.
- **Role Assignment Limits**:
  - 2,000 role assignments per subscription.
  - 500 role assignments per management group.
- **Inheritance**: Role assignments at a parent scope (e.g., subscription) are inherited by child scopes (e.g., resource group).

# 1. Azure Policy Overview

Azure Policy is a governance tool that enforces rules and standards across your Azure environment. It works alongside Azure RBAC to:

- Allow/Deny resource creation or updates.
- Audit compliance.
- Automate actions like tagging.

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Policy Definition** | A JSON-based rule that defines compliance requirements (e.g., allowed regions). |
| **Policy Assignment** | Applies a policy definition to a specific scope (e.g., subscription, resource group). |
| **Initiative Definition** | A collection of policy definitions grouped for a common goal.           |
| **Initiative Assignment** | Applies an initiative definition to a scope.                           |
| **Scope**             | The boundary where the policy is applied (e.g., management group, subscription, resource group). |

## Policy Effects

| Effect               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deny**             | Blocks non-compliant resource creation or updates.                          |
| **Audit**            | Logs non-compliant resources without blocking them.                         |
| **Append**           | Adds required properties (e.g., tags) to resources.                         |
| **DeployIfNotExists** | Deploys resources if compliance is not met.                                |

## Policy Definition Structure

| Element              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mode**             | Specifies the type of resources the policy applies to (e.g., All).          |
| **Parameters**       | Configurable inputs for the policy (e.g., allowed regions).                 |
| **Display Name**     | User-friendly name for the policy.                                          |
| **Description**      | Explanation of the policy’s purpose.                                        |
| **Policy Rule**      | JSON logic defining compliance and effects.                                 |
| **Effect**           | Action taken when a resource is non-compliant (e.g., Deny, Audit).          |

## Steps to Create and Assign a Policy

1. **Create a Policy Definition**:
   - Go to **Policy > Definitions** in the Azure portal.
   - Click **+ Policy Definition**.
   - Define the policy in JSON or use the portal interface.

2. **Assign the Policy**:
   - Go to **Policy > Assignments**.
   - Click **Assign Policy**.
   - Select the policy definition and scope (e.g., subscription, resource group).
   - Configure exclusions if needed.

3. **Create an Initiative**:
   - Go to **Policy > Definitions**.
   - Click **+ Initiative Definition**.
   - Add multiple policy definitions to the initiative.
   - Assign the initiative to a scope.

## Example: Dev/Test Compliance Initiative

- **Policy 1**: Require the tag `Environment` with value `Dev/Test`.
- **Policy 2**: Allow only specific VM SKUs (e.g., `Standard_A1`, `Standard_D2`).
- **Exclusion**: Exclude the `rgCoreNetwork` resource group.

## Scopes and Exclusions

| Scope                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Management Group** | Applies to all child subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.         |
| **Subscription**     | Applies to all resource groups and resources within the subscription.        |
| **Resource Group**   | Applies to all resources within the resource group.                         |
| **Exclusions**       | Exclude specific child scopes (e.g., a resource group within a subscription). |

## Compliance Monitoring

- Compliance is evaluated hourly.
- View compliance status in the **Policy > Compliance** blade.
- Non-compliant resources can be remediated manually or automatically.

# 2. Azure Resource Locks Overview

Resource locks prevent accidental deletion or modification of Azure resources. They are applied at the **management plane** and do not affect the resource’s functionality.

## Types of Resource Locks

| Lock Type       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CanNotDelete** | Prevents deletion of a resource but allows modifications.                  |
| **ReadOnly**    | Prevents both modifications and deletions of a resource.                    |

## Key Features

| Feature            | Details                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**          | Locks can be applied at:                                                |
|                    | - Subscription                                                          |
|                    | - Resource Group                                                        |
|                    | - Resource                                                              |
| **Inheritance**    | Locks applied at a parent scope (e.g., resource group) are inherited by child resources. |
| **Effect on Operations** | - **CanNotDelete**: Blocks deletion but allows updates.             |
|                    | - **ReadOnly**: Blocks both updates and deletions.                      |
| **Management Plane** | Locks only affect management operations (e.g., modifying or deleting resources), not data plane operations (e.g., reading data). |

## Important Notes

- **ReadOnly Lock Side Effects**:
  - Prevents actions that require write access (e.g., creating containers in a storage account).
  - Blocks reading access keys for storage accounts.
- **CanNotDelete Lock Side Effects**:
  - Prevents deletion of a resource group if any resource within it has a `CanNotDelete` lock.
- **Lock Inheritance**:
  - `ReadOnly` and `CanNotDelete` locks are inherited by child resources.
- **Lock Application**:
  - Locks can be applied via:
    - **Azure Portal**
    - **Azure PowerShell**
    - **Azure CLI**
    - **Resource Manager Templates**
    - **REST API**

## Steps to Create a Resource Lock (Azure Portal)

1. Navigate to the desired scope (e.g., subscription, resource group, or resource).
2. Go to the **Locks** blade.
3. Click **+ Add**.
4. Provide:
   - **Lock Name**: A unique name for the lock.
   - **Lock Type**: Choose `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly`.
   - **Notes**: Optional description of the lock’s purpose.
5. Click **Save**.

## Moving Resources

### Key Aspects
| Aspect                | Details                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Supported Resources** | Not all resources can be moved. Check Move Support.                     |
| **Move Constraints**  | - Resources are locked during the move.                                 |
|                       | - Move operations can take up to 4 hours.                               |
| **Cross-Subscription** | Both subscriptions must be in the same Azure AD tenant.                 |
| **Resource Provider** | The resource provider must be registered in the target subscription.    |
| **Quotas**            | Ensure the target subscription has sufficient quotas (e.g., vCPUs).     |
| **Dependencies**      | Dependent resources must be moved together.                             |

### Steps to Move Resources (Azure Portal)
1. Go to the **Resource Group** containing the resources.
2. Click **Move > Move to Another Resource Group** or **Move to Another Subscription**.
3. Select the resources and the destination resource group.
4. Acknowledge the changes and click **Move**.

---

## Validation API

Use the `validateMoveResources` API to check if resources can be moved.

### Request
```json
{
  "resources": ["<resource-id-1>", "<resource-id-2>"],
  "targetResourceGroup": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<target-group>"
}
```

### Response
1. HTTP 204: Move is valid.
2. HTTP 409: Move is invalid (with error details).

---

# 5. Deleting Resource Groups Overview

Deleting a resource group removes all resources within it in a single operation. This action is irreversible, so caution is required to avoid deleting dependent resources.

## Key Points

| Aspect               | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**            | Deleting a resource group removes all contained resources.              |
| **Dependencies**     | Ensure no dependent resources exist (e.g., an App Service depending on an App Service Plan). |
| **Irreversible Action** | Once deleted, resources cannot be recovered.                           |
| **Deletion Time**    | Can take several minutes as resources are deleted individually.         |

---

## Steps to Delete a Resource Group

### Azure Portal
1. Navigate to the **Resource Group**.
2. Click **Delete Resource Group**.
3. Confirm by typing the resource group name.
4. Review the list of affected resources.
5. Click **Delete**.

---

## Handling Dependencies

### Check Dependencies
- Ensure no resources depend on the resource group being deleted.
- For example, an App Service depends on an App Service Plan.

### Clear Dependencies
- Remove or disassociate dependent resources before deletion.

---

## Example Scenario

| Resource Group    | Dependent Resource | Action Before Deletion                  |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| MyResourceGroup   | App Service Plan   | Disassociate or delete the App Service. |

---

## Best Practices

- **Audit Resources**: Review all resources in the resource group before deletion.
- **Backup Critical Data**: Ensure important data is backed up before deletion.
- **Use Locks**: Apply `ReadOnly` or `CanNotDelete` locks to prevent accidental deletion.

---

# 6. Azure Subscriptions Overview

An Azure subscription is a logical unit for managing Azure resources, linked to an Azure account (identity in Azure AD). It governs:

- **Access control** (via Azure AD and RBAC).
- **Cost management** (via quotas and tags).
- **Resource governance** (via Azure Policy).

---

## Subscription Types

| Subscription Type          | Description                                                                 |

# 8. Cost Management Overview

Cost management in Azure involves monitoring, optimizing, and controlling Azure spending. Key tools include quotas, budgets, and tags to track and manage costs effectively.

---

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Quotas**   | Limits on resource usage (e.g., VM cores per region).                       |
| **Spending Quotas**   | Alerts for spending thresholds (does not block resource creation).          |
| **Tags**              | Metadata applied to resources for cost tracking and chargeback.             |
| **Budgets**           | Set spending limits and receive alerts when thresholds are reached.         |

---

## Resource Quotas

- **Purpose**: Limit resource usage to prevent overconsumption.
- **Example**: Default limit of 20 VM cores per region.
- **Action**: Request quota increases via Microsoft Support.

---

## Spending Quotas

- **Purpose**: Monitor and alert on spending thresholds.
- **Behavior**: Alerts are triggered when spending exceeds the quota, but resource creation is not blocked.
- **Use Case**: Track departmental or project-specific spending.

---

## Tags for Cost Management

- **Purpose**: Organize resources for cost tracking and chargeback.
- **Example**: Tag resources with `Department: Finance` or `Project: Marketing`.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Chargeback**: Bill departments for their Azure usage.
  - **Showback**: Provide visibility into departmental spending.

---

## Steps to Configure Cost Management

### Set Resource Quotas
1. Go to **Subscriptions > Usage + Quotas**.
2. View current usage and request quota increases if needed.

### Create Budgets
1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing > Budgets**.
2. Click **+ Add** and configure:
   - **Budget Amount**: Set the spending limit.
   - **Alert Conditions**: Define thresholds for notifications.

### Apply Tags
1. Go to **Resource Groups** or **Resources > Tags**.
2. Add tags (e.g., `Environment: Production`, `CostCenter: 123`).

### Analyze Costs
- Use **Cost Analysis** in **Cost Management + Billing** to:
  - View spending by tags, resource groups, or services.
  - Identify cost-saving opportunities.

---

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Regularly**: Use **Cost Management + Billing** to track spending trends.
- **Set Alerts**: Configure budgets to receive notifications before overspending.
- **Use Tags**: Apply tags consistently for accurate cost tracking and chargeback.
- **Optimize Resources**: Use **Azure Advisor** to identify underutilized resources.

# 9. Resource Quotas Overview

Resource quotas (or service limits) define the maximum usage of Azure resources (e.g., VM cores, storage accounts) within a subscription. Quotas are applied per region and per resource type.

---

## Key Points

| Aspect               | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Prevent overconsumption of resources and ensure fair usage.             |
| **Default Limits**   | Vary by resource type (e.g., 20 VM cores per region by default).        |
| **Quota Increase**   | Requires a support request to Microsoft (not guaranteed).               |
| **Monitoring**       | Use the Azure portal or PowerShell to track quota usage.                |

---

## Steps to View and Increase Quotas

### View Quotas
1. Go to **Subscriptions > Usage + Quotas** in the Azure portal.
2. Filter by service, resource provider, or location.

### Request Quota Increase
1. Click **Request Increase** on the **Usage + Quotas** blade.
2. Fill out the support request form:
   - Select quota type (e.g., Compute/VM cores).
   - Provide a description for the request.
3. Submit the request and wait for Microsoft Support to respond.

---

## PowerShell Commands for Quota Monitoring

| Cmdlet               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Get-AzVMUsage`      | View vCPU quota usage for virtual machines.      |
| `Get-AzStorageUsage` | View storage service quota usage.                |

---

## Important Notes

- **Quota Increases**: Submitting a request does not guarantee an increase. Microsoft Support evaluates each request individually.
- **Regional Limits**: Quotas are applied per region (e.g., East US, West Europe).
- **Compatibility**: Use the `Az` module for PowerShell (replaces `AzureRm`).

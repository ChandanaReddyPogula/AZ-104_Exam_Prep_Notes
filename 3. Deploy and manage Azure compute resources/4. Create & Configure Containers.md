## Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Container Image**      | A compressed package containing the application, dependencies, and OS services. |
| **Container Runtime**    | Software (e.g., Docker) that runs containers by downloading and extracting images. |
| **Isolation**            | Containers run in isolated environments but share the host OS kernel.        |
| **Lightweight OS**       | Containers use lightweight OS versions (e.g., Windows Server Core, Alpine Linux). |
| **Cross-Platform Limitation** | Linux containers cannot run on Windows hosts, and vice versa.          |

## Advantages of Containers

- **Resource Efficiency:**
  - Require fewer resources than VMs.
  - More containers can run on a single host compared to VMs.
- **Portability:**
  - Easily move applications between environments (e.g., on-premises to cloud).
- **Simplified Deployment:**
  - Consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Scalability:**

# Scaling in AKS

AKS provides flexible scaling options to handle varying workloads. You can scale pods (application instances) and nodes (underlying VMs) either manually or automatically.

---

## Key Scaling Concepts

| Scaling Type         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pod Scaling**      | Adjust the number of pods running your application.                         |
| **Node Scaling**     | Adjust the number of nodes (VMs) in the AKS cluster.                        |
| **Manual Scaling**   | Manually set the number of pods or nodes.                                   |
| **Automatic Scaling**| Automatically adjust pods or nodes based on metrics like CPU usage.         |

---

## Manual Scaling

### 1. Scaling Pods
- **Tool:** Use `kubectl` (Kubernetes command-line tool).
- **Steps:**
  1. Install `kubectl` using the command: `az aks install-cli`.
  2. Authenticate to the AKS cluster using: `az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks_rg --name aks_cluster`.
  3. Scale pods using: `kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/az104`.

### 2. Scaling Nodes
- **Tool:** Use Azure CLI or PowerShell.
- **Azure CLI:** Use the command: `az aks scale --resource-group aks_rg --name aks_cluster --node-count 3`.
- **PowerShell:** Use the command: `Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName aks_rg -Name aks_cluster | Set-AzAksCluster -NodeCount 3`.

---

## Automatic Scaling

### 1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- **What It Does:** Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU or memory usage.
- **Command:** Use `kubectl autoscale deployment az104 --cpu-percent=60 --max=5 --min=2` to set the CPU threshold to 60%, with a minimum of 2 pods and a maximum of 5 pods.

### 2. Cluster Autoscaler
- **What It Does:** Automatically scales the number of nodes in the cluster based on pod resource requirements.
- **Command:** Use `az aks update --resource-group aks_rg --name aks_cluster --enable-cluster-autoscaler --max-count 5 --min-count 1` to set a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 5 nodes.

---

## Key Takeaways

| Scaling Type         | Tool/Command                          | Use Case                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Manual Pod Scaling** | `kubectl scale`                      | Adjust pod count manually.               |
| **Manual Node Scaling** | `az aks scale` or `Set-AzAksCluster` | Adjust node count manually.              |
| **Automatic Pod Scaling** | `kubectl autoscale` (HPA)           | Scale pods based on CPU/memory usage.    |
| **Automatic Node Scaling** | `az aks update` (Cluster Autoscaler) | Scale nodes based on pod resource needs. |

---

## Visual Representation

# Networking in AKS

AKS supports two networking models: **kubenet (basic)** and **Azure CNI (advanced)**. Both models handle IP addressing for nodes and pods differently, and Kubernetes uses services and ingress controllers to manage network traffic.

---

## Key Networking Models

| Model               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kubenet (Basic)** | - Nodes get IPs from the VNet subnet.                                       |
|                     | - Pods get internal IPs from a separate address space.                      |
|                     | - Requires NAT for external communication.                                  |
| **Azure CNI (Advanced)** | - Both nodes and pods get IPs from the VNet subnet.                     |
|                     | - No NAT required; pods can communicate directly with other Azure resources. |

---

## Kubernetes Services

Services provide a stable IP address for pods, which are ephemeral and frequently change IPs. They act as a load balancer for incoming traffic.

### Service Types

| Type              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ClusterIP**     | Provides an internal IP for communication within the cluster.               |
| **NodePort**      | Maps a port on the node to the service, allowing external access.           |
| **LoadBalancer**  | Creates an Azure Load Balancer with an external IP for public access.       |
| **ExternalName**  | Maps a service to a DNS name.                                               |

   - Use **LoadBalancer** for public access.
3. **Advanced Routing:**
   - Use **Ingress Controllers** (e.g., NGINX, AGIC) for URL/path-based routing.

### Service vs. Ingress

| Feature              | Service                          | Ingress                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Traffic Routing**  | Basic load balancing.            | Advanced routing (e.g., URL/path-based). |
| **Use Case**         | Simple internal/external access. | Complex traffic management.      |

---

## Best Practices

- **Choose the Right Networking Model:**
  - Use **kubenet** for simplicity and fewer IP addresses.
  - Use **Azure CNI** for direct pod communication and no NAT.
- **Use Services for Stable IPs:**
  - Ensure pods remain accessible despite IP changes.
- **Leverage Ingress Controllers:**
  - Use **NGINX** or **AGIC** for advanced traffic routing.

# Upgrading an AKS Cluster

Upgrading an AKS cluster ensures access to new features, bug fixes, and security patches. The process involves checking for available upgrades and applying them in a controlled manner to avoid downtime.

---

## Key Steps for Upgrading AKS

### Check for Available Upgrades:
- Use the Azure CLI command: `az aks get-upgrades --resource-group aks_rg --name aks_cluster`.
- The output (in JSON) shows available Kubernetes versions under the `upgrades` section.

### Upgrade the Cluster:
- Use the Azure CLI command: `az aks upgrade --resource-group aks_rg --name aks_cluster --kubernetes-version 1.21.1`.
- Replace `1.21.1` with the desired Kubernetes version.

---

## Upgrade Process

### Node-by-Node Upgrade:
- AKS upgrades one node at a time to ensure application availability.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Cordon the Node:** Stop scheduling new pods on the node.
  2. **Drain the Node:** Move running pods to other nodes.
  3. **Create a New Node:** Spin up a new node with the upgraded Kubernetes version.
  4. **Delete the Old Node:** Remove the node running the older version.
- Repeat the process for all nodes in the cluster.

### Version Skipping:
- Cannot skip minor versions. For example:
  - To upgrade from `1.19.3` to `1.21.1`, you must first upgrade to `1.20.x`.

## Key Takeaways

| Step                  | Command/Tool            | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Check Upgrades**    | `az aks get-upgrades`   | Lists available Kubernetes versions.                                        |
| **Upgrade Cluster**   | `az aks upgrade`        | Upgrades the cluster to the specified version.                              |
| **Node-by-Node Upgrade** | Automated by AKS     | Ensures minimal disruption during upgrades.                                 |
| **Version Skipping**  | Not allowed             | Must upgrade sequentially through minor versions.                           |

---

### Upgrade Workflow
1. **Check for Upgrades:**
   - Use `az aks get-upgrades` to list available versions.
2. **Initiate Upgrade:**
   - Use `az aks upgrade` to start the upgrade process.
3. **Node-by-Node Process:**
   - Cordon â†’ Drain â†’ Create New Node â†’ Delete Old Node.
4. **Repeat:**
   - Continue until all nodes are upgraded.

### Version Upgrade Path

| Current Version | Upgrade Path                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1.19.3          | 1.19.3 â†’ 1.20.x â†’ 1.21.1      |
| 1.20.5          | 1.20.5 â†’ 1.21.1               |

---

## Best Practices

- **Plan Upgrades:**
  - Regularly check for new Kubernetes versions.
  - Test upgrades in a non-production environment first.
- **Avoid Skipping Versions:**
  - Follow the sequential upgrade path (e.g., 1.19 â†’ 1.20 â†’ 1.21).
- **Monitor During Upgrades:**
  - Use Azure Monitor or Kubernetes Dashboard to track the upgrade process.

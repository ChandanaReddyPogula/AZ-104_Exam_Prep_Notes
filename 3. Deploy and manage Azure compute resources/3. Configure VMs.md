# Networking Configuration for Azure Virtual Machines

When provisioning a VM in Azure, you can configure the following networking options:

| Option                          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Virtual Network, Subnet, and Public IP** | Assign a VNet, subnet, and public IP address during VM creation.           |
| **Network Security Group (NSG)** | Apply an NSG to the NIC to control inbound/outbound traffic.               |
| **Public Inbound Ports**         | Specify which ports should be open for inbound traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH, RDP). |
| **Accelerated Networking**       | Enable for improved network performance (requires specific VM sizes and images). |
| **Azure Load Balancer**          | Add the VM to an existing Load Balancer back-end pool.                      |

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- **Purpose:** Act as a firewall to control traffic using security rules.
- **Application:** Can be applied to NICs or subnets.
- **Best Practice:** Associate NSGs to subnets (instead of individual NICs) for easier management.

### 2. Application Security Groups (ASGs)
- **Purpose:** Group VMs by application roles and define security policies based on workloads.
- **Use Case:** Simplify network security by focusing on applications rather than IP addresses.

---

## Accelerated Networking

### What It Does:
- Improves network performance by enabling **Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)**.
- **Benefits:** Bypasses the virtual switch, reducing latency and improving throughput.

### Prerequisites:
- Supported VM sizes (e.g., D/DSv2, F/Fs series, D/DSv3, E/ESv3, Fsv2, Ms/Mms).
- Supported OS images (see below).
- All VMs in an availability set or VMSS must be stopped/deallocated before enabling.

---

### Supported OS Images

| **Windows**                     | **Linux**                                   |

| Windows Server 2019 Datacenter  | Ubuntu 16.04 or later                       |
| Windows Server 2016 Datacenter  | Ubuntu 14.04 (with Linux-Azure kernel)      |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter | SLES 12 SP3 or later                       |
|                                 | RHEL 7.4 or later                          |
|                                 | CentOS 7.4 or later                        |
|                                 | CoreOS Linux                               |
|                                 | Debian “Stretch” with backports kernel     |
|                                 | Oracle Linux 7.4+ (with specific kernels)  |
|                                 | FreeBSD 10.4, 11.1, 12.0                   |

---

## Key Takeaways
- **NSGs** are critical for managing traffic flow to/from VMs.
- **ASGs** simplify security by grouping VMs based on application roles.
- **Accelerated Networking** significantly boosts performance but requires specific VM sizes and OS images.
- Always check prerequisites before enabling advanced features like Accelerated Networking.

## Accelerated Networking vs. Standard Networking

| Feature                     | Without Accelerated Networking       | With Accelerated Networking         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Performance**             | Lower throughput, higher latency    | Higher throughput, lower latency    |
| **Virtual Switch**          | Traffic passes through virtual switch | Bypasses virtual switch             |
| **Use Case**                | General-purpose workloads           | High-performance, low-latency workloads |

# Connecting to Azure Virtual Machines

There are multiple ways to connect to Azure VMs, depending on the network configuration and security requirements.

---

## Connection Methods

| Method                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public IP Address**      | Connect directly using the VM’s public IP address.                          |
| **Private IP Address**     | Requires additional connectivity (e.g., ExpressRoute, Site-to-Site VPN, or Point-to-Site VPN) to access the VM on its private IP. |
| **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** | Use NSGs to restrict access to specific ports (e.g., RDP for Windows, SSH for Linux). |

---

## Authentication Options

### Windows VMs
- **Username:**
  - Max 20 characters.
  - Cannot end with a period (`.`).
  - Blocked names: `admin`, `administrator`, `john`, `123`, etc.
- **Password:**
  - Length: 12–123 characters.
  - Must meet complexity requirements.

### Linux VMs
- **Username:**
  - Length: 1–32 characters.
  - Blocked names: Easily guessable usernames.
- **Password:**
  - Length: 6–72 characters.
- **SSH Public Key:**
  - Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048`.
  - Retrieve public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
  - Paste the public key into the Azure portal during VM creation.

---

## Adding Network Interfaces

A network interface (NIC) enables a VM to communicate with the internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. Multiple NICs are useful for:

- **Network and Security Functions:** E.g., load balancers, firewalls, and proxy servers.
- **Network Isolation:** Separate public-facing services from internal networks.
- **Bandwidth Isolation:** Ensure minimal bandwidth for critical workloads (e.g., heartbeat signals).

### Steps to Add a NIC
1. Go to the VM’s **Networking** blade in the Azure portal.
2. Click **Attach Network Interface**.
3. Choose to attach an existing NIC or create a new one.
4. Deallocate the VM before attaching the NIC (stop the VM).
5. Attach the NIC and restart the VM.

---

## Primary vs. Secondary NICs
- The first NIC is the primary interface by default.
- Outbound traffic is routed through the primary NIC unless configured otherwise.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Public IP:** Use for direct access; secure with NSGs.
- **Private IP:** Requires VPN or ExpressRoute for access.
- **Authentication:**
  - Windows: Complex usernames and passwords.
  - Linux: SSH keys or passwords.
- **Multiple NICs:**
  - Useful for isolation, security, and bandwidth management.
  - Primary NIC handles outbound traffic by default.

---

## Connection Methods

| Method               | Use Case                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public IP + NSG**  | Direct access with restricted ports (e.g., RDP/SSH).                    |
| **Private IP + VPN** | Secure access from on-premises or other Azure networks.                 |
| **ExpressRoute**     | High-speed, private connection to Azure.                                |

## Multiple NICs

| NIC Type         | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary NIC**  | Handles outbound traffic by default.                                    |
| **Secondary NICs** | Used for isolation, security, or bandwidth management.                 |

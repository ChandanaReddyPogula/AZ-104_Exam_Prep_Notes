# Developing a Monitoring Strategy for Azure

## Key Concepts

### Purpose of Monitoring
- Gain visibility into the health, performance, and cost of Azure services.
- Proactively identify and resolve issues to increase uptime.
- Optimize resources for cost efficiency and performance.

### Three Key Areas of Monitoring
1. **Visibility into Services and Azure Platform**:
   - Monitor metrics, set up alerts, and create dashboards.
2. **Deeper Insights into Applications**:
   - Use service maps, dependency tracking, and advanced tracing.
3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Analyze metrics to optimize performance and reduce costs.

## Steps to Develop a Monitoring Strategy

### 1. Define Monitoring Goals
- Identify key metrics for each service (e.g., CPU usage, response time, storage utilization).
- Set performance baselines and thresholds for alerts.
- Determine cost optimization goals (e.g., right-sizing VMs, deleting unused resources).

### 2. Use Azure Monitor
- **Collect Metrics**:
  - Enable metrics collection for Azure resources (e.g., VMs, storage accounts).
  - Use **Diagnostic Settings** to send logs to Log Analytics or Azure Storage.
- **Set Up Alerts**:
  - Create metric alerts for critical thresholds (e.g., CPU > 90%).
  - Use activity log alerts for administrative changes (e.g., VM deletion).
- **Create Dashboards**:
  - Build custom dashboards in Azure Monitor to visualize key metrics.
  - Use workbooks for advanced visualizations and insights.

### 3. Gain Deeper Insights
- **Service Maps**:
  - Use Azure Monitor for VMs to map dependencies between resources.
  - Identify bottlenecks and performance issues.
- **Application Insights**:
  - Monitor application performance (e.g., response times, failure rates).
  - Use distributed tracing to track requests across services.
- **Log Analytics**:
  - Write KQL queries to analyze log data.
  - Create log-based alerts for specific events (e.g., failed login attempts).

### 4. Optimize Resources
- **Right-Size VMs**:
  - Use Azure Advisor to identify underutilized VMs.
  - Resize or deallocate VMs to reduce costs.
- **Monitor Costs**:
  - Use Azure Cost Management to track spending.
  - Set budgets and alerts for cost overruns.
- **Automate Remediation**:
  - Use Azure Automation or Logic Apps to automate responses to alerts (e.g., restart a VM).
